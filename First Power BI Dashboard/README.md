# First Power BI Dashboard


## General:
This is the first dashboard I made using Power BI. My inspiration to learn Power BI is from my business analytics Internship 
where our goal is to create a Power BI app for the company to use better to make decisions from our Microsfot Access Data Base. 
I followed this [Microsoft Tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-excel-stunning-report) 
step by step to learn the basics of making a dashboard in Power BI.

## Dashboard:
Since I can not publish this dashboard without a "Power BI Pro License" I have attached a screenshot of the dashboard I made. As you can see, it
looks exactly like the one from the tutorial. I did it this way to ensure I understood the new Power BI tools.
